    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">I accidentally deleted a photo. Can I get it back?</div>
        <p>Yes, in most cases! MediaCleaner deletes files by moving them to your iOS <strong>"Recently Deleted"</strong>
            album. Open your Photos app, go to Albums -> Recently Deleted, and you can recover them there. They
            typically stay there for 30 days.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">How does Smart Cleaning work?</div>
        <p>Smart Cleaning scans your library for duplicates, blurry photos, screenshots, and large video files. It runs
            entirely on your device and suggests items for deletion, but you always have the final say before anything
            is removed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">I bought Premium but it's not showing up.</div>
        <p>Please tap the <strong>"Restore Purchases"</strong> button on the upgrade screen. Ensure you are signed into
            the same Apple ID used for purchase.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">Why does the app need Photo Library permission?</div>
        <p>MediaCleaner needs "Full Access" to your Photo Library to analyze your storage usage and perform the deletion
            actions you request. Without this permission, the app cannot function.</p>
    </div>
